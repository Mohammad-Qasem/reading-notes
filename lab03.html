        <p>Hi There &#129321</p>
        <p> Do you want to build your simple web page :wink: easily and quickly?</p>
        <p> Well... Check out.</p>
        <p> Markdown is a way to style text on the web and it is Easy On The Eyes and light in weight. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with (Markdown).</p>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <p>1-It is easy to write some words with the preferred style.</p>
        <p>if you need your words in bold style so write **youre text** to be like (<b>your text</b>) or in italic style like *your text*.to be like (<em>your text</em>) </p>
        <p>2-If you need to list of points, just write:</p>
        <p>-for the first point.</p>
        <p>-for the second point.</p>
        <p>-for the third point.</p>
        <p>it is simple as that &#128525</p>
        <p>3- you want to write a link.</p>
        <p>just write [your link ](khttp://github.com).</p>
        <p>just paste your link between brackets. really easy &#129305 </p>
        <p>4- you can add an image</p>
