# What is computers and how they work

A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

# circuit and logic inside computer.

Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit.Circuits enables computers to do more complex operations than they could accomplish with just a single gate.The smallest circuit is a chain of 2 logic gates.

## The three main ways of specifying the function of a combinational logic circuit are:

1. Boolean Algebra – This forms the algebraic expression showing the operation of the logic circuit for each input variable either True or False that results in a logic “1” output.

2. Truth Table – A truth table defines the function of a logic gate by providing a concise list that shows all the output states in tabular form for each possible combination of input variable that the gate could encounter.

3. Logic Diagram – This is a graphical representation of a logic circuit that shows the wiring and connections of each individual logic gate, represented by a specific graphical symbol, that implements the logic circuit.

and all three of these logic circuit representations are shown below.

# Cpu and memory.

simply A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program.

Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.

There are several memories in compters are RAM and ROM:

There are several major differences between a ROM (read-only memory) chip and a RAM (random-access memory) chip. The differences revolve around the uses, storage capabilities and capacity, and physical sizes of ROM and RAM chips.
