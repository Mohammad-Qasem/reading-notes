# javascript

hi friend , have ever listened about javascript programming language, i think you do so let me tell you a little pit about it.

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

as any other language it has Expressions and Operators,so let me tell you some of it.

## Expressions and Operators.

 ### operator:
 
 1-Assignment operator.
 
 for examble:         
                                        
                 x = y 
                 
 2-Arithmetic operators. 
 
 An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are
 addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
 
 for examble:
 
                1 / 2 == 1.0 / 2.0; // this is true
                
 3-Comparison operators.
 
 A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object
 values.
 
 for examble:
 
  * Equal (==)
  * Not equal (!=)
  * Strict equal (===)
  * Greater than (>)
  * Greater than or equal (>=)
  * Less than (<)
  * Less than or equal (<=)
  
  
  4-String operators:
  
  In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string
  that is the union of the two operand strings.
  
   for examble:
   
          ('my ' + 'string'); // the string is "my string".
          
          
  ## Functions.
  
  Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
  
  for example
  
  checking if the number is less than 5 so lets write if 2 is less than 5 
  
                               
                                function checless() {
                                   if (number < 5 ){
                                      alert(number);
                                   } else {
                                  alert("the number is larger than 5");
                                  }
   
   and if the condition didnot meet so it will execute Else statement.
