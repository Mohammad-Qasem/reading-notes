# Build your simple web page.


Hi There :smile:
Do you want to build your simple web page :wink: easly and quickly ?
Well... Check out.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with (Markdown).

For examble,

1-It is easy to write some words with preferred style.
if you need your words in bold style so write 

     **youre text**
 to be like **your text**    

or in italic style like     
       
       *your text*.
       
 to be like **your text**  

2-If you need to list of points ,just write:

     1-for the first point.
     
     2-for the second point.
     
     3-for the third point.
     
     
it is simple as that :heart_eyes:
     
3-you want to write link.

         [your link ](khttp://github.com)
