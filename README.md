Markdown is a way to style text on the web and its is Easy On The Eyesand light in weight. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with (Markdown).

For example,

1-It is easy to write some words with the preferred style.

if you need your words in bold style so write 

     **youre text**
 to be like (**your text**)    

or in italic style like     
       
       *your text*.
       
 to be like (*your text*)  

2-If you need to list of points,just write:

     1-for the first point.
     
     2-for the second point.
     
     3-for the third point.
     
     
it is simple as that :heart_eyes:
     
3-you want to write a link.

just write 

         [your link ](khttp://github.com)

 # level up your mindset.
 
 ***befor we talking about mindset , we should know what is mindset mean.***
 
 There are two different types of mindset:
 
 1-People with a fixed mindset believe that these qualities are inborn, fixed, and unchangeable.
 
 2-Those with a growth mindset, on the other hand, believe that these abilities can be developed and strengthened by way of commitment and hard work.
 
 so as you understand the differences between the two types of mindset you can know how a growth mindset is really important. growth mindset actually makes you stronger and   helps to overcome any obstacles you may face. it makes you belive in your ability to achieve whatever you want and in any field you want to get into.
 
 This image gives an intuition idea about the mindset

 #### what should i do to keep growth mindsit?
 
 *1-efforts:*
 
 when you need to focus on something which you may find difficult to achieve, you should try again, again and again, with all of your efforts because Hard work should always be rewarded before inherent skill and believe in your ability until you success.
 
 *2-Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”*:
 
 you should belive that When you make a mistake or fall short of a goal, you haven’t failed; you’ve learned.
 
 *3-Celebrate growth with others*:
 
 If you truly appreciate growth, you’ll want to share your progress with others.
