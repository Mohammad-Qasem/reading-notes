Markdown is a way to style text on the web and its is Easy On The Eyesand light in weight. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with (Markdown).

For example,

1-It is easy to write some words with the preferred style.

if you need your words in bold style so write 

     **youre text**
 to be like (**your text**)    

or in italic style like     
       
       *your text*.
       
 to be like (*your text*)  

2-If you need to list of points,just write:

     1-for the first point.
     
     2-for the second point.
     
     3-for the third point.
