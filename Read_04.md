## Structure web pages with HTML

the basic structutre of html as shown in the picture

![Structure](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/0W9vL1_b6fYSAWpRggrPjpMQHHHYUU57QdhZ91yklV4JZGU_r3QgtrfLC-MqTB76N40jBsTkGUhqqjoNmT7t_MMM9Ha-gvkJnT0NqwUAXNWogjI1lZ4)



* The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.

* The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing, </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
*Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.

* paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.

* Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.

* Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags.(smaller size text)

* The closing </body> tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window.

* The closing </html> tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code.



                           <html>
                            <head>
                              <title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
                            </head>
                            <body>
                              <h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
                              <p>Anything within the body of a web page is
                               displayed in the main browser window.</p>
                            </body>
                           </html>


so you can notice that HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.


## HTML5 Layout.

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
you can see the traditional html layout in the following picture.

* Headers & Footers:

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:

1- The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

2-A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

                               <header>
                                 <h1>Yoko's Kitchen</h1>
                                 <nav>
                                    <ul>
                                     <li><a href="" class="current">home</a></li>
                                     <li><a href="">classes</a></li>
                                     <li><a href="">catering</a></li>
                                     <li><a href="">about</a></li>
                                     <li><a href="">contact</a></li>
                                    </ul>
                                 </nav>
                               </header>

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
